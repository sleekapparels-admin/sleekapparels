2:T2969,{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the minimum order quantity (MOQ) for custom t-shirts at Sleek Apparels?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Our minimum order quantity for custom t-shirts is just 50 pieces per style/color combination. This is significantly lower than most Bangladesh manufacturers who require 500-1,000 pieces. You can mix sizes within the 50-piece order (for example: 10 Small, 15 Medium, 15 Large, 10 XL). If you need multiple colors of the same design, each color requires a separate 50-piece minimum. This low MOQ makes us ideal for startups, small brands, event merchandise, corporate orders, and testing new designs before committing to large inventory."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What t-shirt fabric options do you offer?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"We offer extensive fabric choices to match your quality and price point: 100% Cotton (ringspun or combed cotton, 150gsm-220gsm, soft and breathable, most popular for everyday tees), Cotton-Polyester Blends (50/50 or 60/40 cotton-poly, 160gsm-180gsm, more affordable, wrinkle-resistant, faster drying), Tri-Blend (50% polyester, 25% cotton, 25% rayon, 145gsm-160gsm, ultra-soft vintage feel, excellent drape), Organic Cotton (GOTS-certified 100% organic, 180gsm-200gsm, eco-friendly, premium positioning), Pima/Supima Cotton (long-staple premium cotton, 180gsm-200gsm, luxurious feel, higher durability), Performance Fabrics (moisture-wicking polyester or poly-cotton, 140gsm-160gsm, athletic/activewear applications).

Any garments failing inspection are remade at no cost to you. We maintain a defect rate below 0.5% (industry standard is 2-4%).
