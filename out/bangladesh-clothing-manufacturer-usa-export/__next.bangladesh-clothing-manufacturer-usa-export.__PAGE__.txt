Complete Rejection (Extremely Rare): If shipment must return to Bangladesh: We warehouse at no cost while resolving issues, remake products if required at discounted rate, credit deposit toward replacement order, absorb return shipping costs if our manufacturing error.

17:T4e6,Yes, we specialize in US sizing and grading standards - this is critical for selling to American consumers. Our US sizing expertise: Standard US Size Ranges: Men's (S, M, L, XL, 2XL, 3XL) with proper proportions, Women's (XS, S, M, L, XL, 2XL, 3XL) accounting for different body shapes, Plus sizes (1X, 2X, 3X, 4X) with appropriate scaling, Kids' sizing by age (2T-16) meeting US safety standards. Size Specifications: We use US measurement standards (inches, not cm), Grade rules follow US apparel industry standards, Fit is designed for Western body types (broader shoulders, longer torso, larger dimensions), Length, chest, waist, hip measurements match US consumer expectations. Sizing Consultation: We provide size charts in US sizing format, Sample multiple sizes for fit approval, Adjust patterns based on your target demographic (athletic fit, regular fit, relaxed fit, oversized), Can create custom size runs (more mediums/larges, fewer smalls). Common mistake new US brands make: Using Asian sizing specs results in products 1-2 sizes too small for US customers. We prevent this by defaulting to US standards and having US sizing reference samples in our facility. Your customers receive true-to-size products that match US retail expectations.d:["$","details","8",{"className":"group bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg overflow-hidden border border-gray-200 hover:border-blue-600 transition-all","children":[["$","summary",null,{"className":"flex justify-between items-center cursor-pointer p-6 font-semibold text-lg text-gray-900 hover:text-blue-600 transition-colors","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"pr-8","children":"Can you produce US sizing vs Asian sizing?"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"flex-shrink-0 text-blue-600 group-open:rotate-180 transition-transform","children":["$","svg",null,{"className":"w-6 h-6","fill":"none","stroke":"currentColor","viewBox":"0 0 24 24","children":["$","path",null,{"strokeLinecap":"round","strokeLinejoin":"round","strokeWidth":2,"d":"M19 9l-7 7-7-7"}]}]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"px-6 pb-6 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed border-t border-gray-100 pt-4","children":"$17"}]]}]
18:T63a,While rare (our clearance success rate is 99.7%), we have clear protocols for customs issues: Documentation Issues: We immediately provide corrected/additional documents, work with customs broker to resolve within 24-48 hours, no cost to you for documentation corrections. Classification or Duty Disputes: We provide supporting documentation for HS code classification, assist with duty rate verification, help file protests if needed for duty refunds. Product Compliance Issues: If products fail inspection (CPSC, textile rules, etc.): We investigate root cause immediately, provide remediation plan (relabeling, testing, or remake), share responsibility based on cause (our error = we cover costs, spec change = negotiated), prevent recurrence with updated QC protocols. Complete Rejection (Extremely Rare): If shipment must return to Bangladesh: We warehouse at no cost while resolving issues, remake products if required at discounted rate, credit deposit toward replacement order, absorb return shipping costs if our manufacturing error. Prevention is Key: We provide pre-shipment inspection photos/video, share all compliance certificates upfront, use experienced customs brokers who pre-clear documentation, maintain 24/7 communication during shipping/clearance. Insurance: We recommend cargo insurance for high-value shipments ($500+ value), covers loss, damage, or rejection scenarios, typically 1-2% of shipment value. In 8+ years shipping to the USA, we've never had a complete rejection. Our expertise in US regulations and documentation ensures smooth customs clearance every time.e:["$","details","9",{"className":"group bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg overflow-hidden border border-gray-200 hover:border-blue-600 transition-all","children":[["$","summary",null,{"className":"flex justify-between items-center cursor-pointer p-6 font-semibold text-lg text-gray-900 hover:text-blue-600 transition-colors","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"pr-8","children":"What happens if my products are detained or rejected at US customs?"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"flex-shrink-0 text-blue-600 group-open:rotate-180 transition-transform","children":["$","svg",null,{"className":"w-6 h-6","fill":"none","stroke":"currentColor","viewBox":"0 0 24 24","children":["$","path",null,{"strokeLinecap":"round","strokeLinejoin":"round","strokeWidth":2,"d":"M19 9l-7 7-7-7"}]}]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"px-6 pb-6 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed border-t border-gray-100 pt-4","children":"$18"}]]}]
