Under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and various trade agreements, many apparel categories enter duty-free or at reduced rates (0-16.5% vs 32% from China). Specific rates depend on product category: T-shirts and basic apparel often qualify for preferential rates, Synthetic garments may have 16-28% duty, Cotton products typically 8-16.5%, Accessories and technical wear vary. We provide complete HS code classification and duty calculations with every quote, helping you understand landed costs upfront. Bangladesh's competitive labor costs plus duty advantages often result in 20-35% total savings vs other manufacturing countries.\"\n    },\n    {\n      question: \"How long does shipping take from Bangladesh to the USA?\",\n      answer: \"We offer flexible shipping options to match your timeline and budget: Express Air Freight (DHL/FedEx): 5-7 days door-to-door, ideal for samples or urgent small orders ($6-9/kg), Standard Air Freight: 8-12 days, cost-effective for orders under 200kg ($4-6/kg), Sea Freight LCL (Less than Container Load): 18-25 days to US ports (LA, NY, Miami), best for 200-1000kg shipments ($2-3/kg), Sea Freight FCL (Full Container Load): 20-28 days, most economical for large orders 1000+ pieces ($1-2/kg). Total timeline from production complete to your warehouse: Air = 1-2 weeks, Sea = 3-4 weeks. We handle all customs clearance, ISF filing, and delivery to your specified address. Most clients choose sea freight for bulk production and air for samples.\"\n    },\n    {\n      question: \"Do you handle US customs clearance and documentation?\",\n      answer: \"Yes, we provide complete export documentation and customs support.

Trade Benefits: Duty-free or reduced tariff access to US market, not subject to Section 301 tariffs affecting Chinese goods, GSP benefits for qualifying products, US-Bangladesh trade growing 15% annually. Ethical Manufacturing: Strong compliance with US labor laws and ethical standards, WRAP and SA8000 certifications standard, no forced labor concerns (unlike some regions), transparent supply chains. Quality & Expertise: 40+ years of apparel manufacturing experience, specialized in woven and knit garments, skilled workforce of 4+ million garment workers, modern facilities with US/EU standard equipment. Communication & Service: English widely spoken in business settings, time zone advantage (12-hour difference allows overnight responses), startup-friendly MOQs (50 pieces vs 500-1000 in China), flexible and responsive to small brand needs. For US startups and small brands, Bangladesh offers the best combination of cost, quality, ethics, and flexibility. You get China-quality manufacturing at significantly lower costs, with better trade terms and ethical peace of mind.\"\n    },\n    {\n      question: \"How do you handle quality control for US market standards?\",\n      answer: \"US market quality standards are non-negotiable, and we've built our QC process specifically around US retailer requirements. Our 8-point inspection system: Pre-Production Sample Approval (you approve samples before bulk production begins, all specs locked in writing), Fabric Inspection (4-point system per ASTM D5430, checking for defects, color consistency, shrinkage testing, weight verification), In-Line Inspection (during production, 30% of pieces checked mid-production, immediate corrections if issues found), Final Random Inspection (AQL 2.5 standard - same as Target, Walmart, Amazon), Measurement Verification (all critical measurements checked against spec sheet, tolerance ±1/4 inch standard), Functionality Testing (zippers, buttons, snaps tested for 50 cycles minimum, seam strength testing, wash testing when required), Compliance Testing (third-party lab testing for CPSC/ASTM when required, lead content, flammability, small parts for kids' products), Pre-Ship Inspection (100% carton check, proper labeling, packing list accuracy, shipment photos/video provided). Defect rate: We maintain <0.8% defect rate (industry standard is 2-4%). Any defects found are remade at no cost. For first-time orders, many US clients hire third-party inspection companies (SGS, Intertek, Bureau Veritas) - we welcome and facilitate these inspections. You receive detailed QC reports with photos at every stage.\"\n    },\n    {\n      question: \"What payment terms do you offer for US clients?\",\n      answer: \"We offer flexible payment terms tailored to US business practices: New Clients (First 1-3 Orders): 30% deposit upon order confirmation (via wire transfer, PayPal, or Wise), 70% balance before shipping (after final inspection approval), Letter of Credit accepted for orders over $10,000.

High-Volume Clients (Regular monthly orders): NET 45-60 terms available, Consignment arrangements considered for proven bestsellers, Volume discounts and price locks for annual contracts.

We're startup-friendly because we remember being one ourselves.\"\n    },\n    {\n      question: \"Can you produce US sizing vs Asian sizing?\",\n      answer: \"Yes, we specialize in US sizing and grading standards - this is critical for selling to American consumers. Our US sizing expertise: Standard US Size Ranges: Men's (S, M, L, XL, 2XL, 3XL) with proper proportions, Women's (XS, S, M, L, XL, 2XL, 3XL) accounting for different body shapes, Plus sizes (1X, 2X, 3X, 4X) with appropriate scaling, Kids' sizing by age (2T-16) meeting US safety standards. Size Specifications: We use US measurement standards (inches, not cm), Grade rules follow US apparel industry standards, Fit is designed for Western body types (broader shoulders, longer torso, larger dimensions), Length, chest, waist, hip measurements match US consumer expectations. Sizing Consultation: We provide size charts in US sizing format, Sample multiple sizes for fit approval, Adjust patterns based on your target demographic (athletic fit, regular fit, relaxed fit, oversized), Can create custom size runs (more mediums/larges, fewer smalls). Common mistake new US brands make: Using Asian sizing specs results in products 1-2 sizes too small for US customers. We prevent this by defaulting to US standards and having US sizing reference samples in our facility. Your customers receive true-to-size products that match US retail expectations.\"\n    },\n    {\n      question: \"What happens if my products are detained or rejected at US customs?\",\n      answer: \"While rare (our clearance success rate is 99.7%), we have clear protocols for customs issues: Documentation Issues: We immediately provide corrected/additional documents, work with customs broker to resolve within 24-48 hours, no cost to you for documentation corrections. Classification or Duty Disputes: We provide supporting documentation for HS code classification, assist with duty rate verification, help file protests if needed for duty refunds. Product Compliance Issues: If products fail inspection (CPSC, textile rules, etc.): We investigate root cause immediately, provide remediation plan (relabeling, testing, or remake), share responsibility based on cause (our error = we cover costs, spec change = negotiated), prevent recurrence with updated QC protocols. Complete Rejection (Extremely Rare): If shipment must return to Bangladesh: We warehouse at no cost while resolving issues, remake products if required at discounted rate, credit deposit toward replacement order, absorb return shipping costs if our manufacturing error. Prevention is Key: We provide pre-shipment inspection photos/video, share all compliance certificates upfront, use experienced customs brokers who pre-clear documentation, maintain 24/7 communication during shipping/clearance. Insurance: We recommend cargo insurance for high-value shipments ($500+ value), covers loss, damage, or rejection scenarios, typically 1-2% of shipment value. In 8+ years shipping to the USA, we've never had a complete rejection. Our expertise in US regulations and documentation ensures smooth customs clearance every time.\"\n    }\n  ];\n\n  const breadcrumbSchema = generateBreadcrumbSchema([\n    { name: 'Home', url: 'https://sleekapparels.com' },\n    { name: 'Services', url: 'https://sleekapparels.com/services' },\n    { name: 'USA Export Manufacturing', url: 'https://sleekapparels.com/bangladesh-clothing-manufacturer-usa-export' }\n  ]);\n\n  const productSchema = generateProductSchema({\n    name: 'Bangladesh to USA Clothing Export Manufacturing Service',\n    description: 'Export-ready Bangladesh clothing manufacturer specializing in USA shipments with customs clearance, CPSC compliance, and duty-free benefits.
