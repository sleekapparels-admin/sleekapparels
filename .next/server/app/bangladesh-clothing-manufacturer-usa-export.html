Our US sizing expertise: Standard US Size Ranges: Men's (S, M, L, XL, 2XL, 3XL) with proper proportions, Women's (XS, S, M, L, XL, 2XL, 3XL) accounting for different body shapes, Plus sizes (1X, 2X, 3X, 4X) with appropriate scaling, Kids' sizing by age (2T-16) meeting US safety standards. Size Specifications: We use US measurement standards (inches, not cm), Grade rules follow US apparel industry standards, Fit is designed for Western body types (broader shoulders, longer torso, larger dimensions), Length, chest, waist, hip measurements match US consumer expectations. Sizing Consultation: We provide size charts in US sizing format, Sample multiple sizes for fit approval, Adjust patterns based on your target demographic (athletic fit, regular fit, relaxed fit, oversized), Can create custom size runs (more mediums/larges, fewer smalls). Common mistake new US brands make: Using Asian sizing specs results in products 1-2 sizes too small for US customers.

Your customers receive true-to-size products that match US retail expectations."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What happens if my products are detained or rejected at US customs?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"While rare (our clearance success rate is 99.7%), we have clear protocols for customs issues: Documentation Issues: We immediately provide corrected/additional documents, work with customs broker to resolve within 24-48 hours, no cost to you for documentation corrections.

Product Compliance Issues: If products fail inspection (CPSC, textile rules, etc.): We investigate root cause immediately, provide remediation plan (relabeling, testing, or remake), share responsibility based on cause (our error = we cover costs, spec change = negotiated), prevent recurrence with updated QC protocols. Complete Rejection (Extremely Rare): If shipment must return to Bangladesh: We warehouse at no cost while resolving issues, remake products if required at discounted rate, credit deposit toward replacement order, absorb return shipping costs if our manufacturing error. Prevention is Key: We provide pre-shipment inspection photos/video, share all compliance certificates upfront, use experienced customs brokers who pre-clear documentation, maintain 24/7 communication during shipping/clearance.

Our expertise in US regulations and documentation ensures smooth customs clearance every time."}}]}</script><main class="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-b from-gray-50 to-white"><section class="relative overflow-hidden bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-700 via-indigo-700 to-purple-800 text-white"><div class="absolute inset-0 bg-black/10"></div><div class="container mx-auto px-4 py-16 md:py-24 relative z-10"><div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto text-center"><div class="inline-block mb-6 px-4 py-2 bg-white/20 backdrop-blur-sm rounded-full text-sm font-semibold">🇺🇸 USA Export Specialist</div><h1 class="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold mb-6 leading-tight">Bangladesh Clothing Manufacturer for USA Export</h1><p class="text-xl md:text-2xl mb-4 text-blue-100 leading-relaxed"><span class="font-bold text-white">Duty-Free Benefits</span> • Customs Cleared • CPSC Compliant • Direct to Your Warehouse</p><p class="text-lg mb-8 text-blue-200">50-Piece MOQ • 6-8 Week Delivery • Amazon FBA Ready • US Sizing</p><div class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-4 justify-center"><a class="inline-block bg-white text-blue-700 px-8 py-4 rounded-lg font-bold text-lg hover:bg-blue-50 transition-all shadow-xl hover:shadow-2xl hover:scale-105" href="/contact/">Get Export Quote</a><a class="inline-block bg-blue-800/50 backdrop-blur-sm border-2 border-white text-white px-8 py-4 rounded-lg font-bold text-lg hover:bg-blue-700/50 transition-all" href="/quote/">Calculate Landed Cost</a></div><p class="mt-6 text-sm text-blue-200">✓ 99.7% Customs Clearance Rate • ✓ Shipped to All 50 US States • ✓ Full Documentation Included</p></div></div></section><section class="py-16 md:py-24 bg-gray-50"><div class="container mx-auto px-4"><div class="max-w-3xl mx-auto text-center mb-16"><h2 class="text-3xl md:text-5xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-900">USA Export Questions Answered</h2><p class="text-xl text-gray-600">Everything you need to know about importing clothing from Bangladesh to the USA.</p></div><div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto space-y-6"><details class="group bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg overflow-hidden border border-gray-200 hover:border-blue-600 transition-all"><summary class="flex justify-between items-center cursor-pointer p-6 font-semibold text-lg text-gray-900 hover:text-blue-600 transition-colors"><span class="pr-8">What are the import duties and tariffs for Bangladesh clothing exports to the USA?</span><span class="flex-shrink-0 text-blue-600 group-open:rotate-180 transition-transform"><svg class="w-6 h-6" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M19 9l-7 7-7-7"></path></svg></span></summary><div class="px-6 pb-6 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed border-t border-gray-100 pt-4">Bangladesh enjoys significant duty advantages for US imports.

Our 8-point inspection system: Pre-Production Sample Approval (you approve samples before bulk production begins, all specs locked in writing), Fabric Inspection (4-point system per ASTM D5430, checking for defects, color consistency, shrinkage testing, weight verification), In-Line Inspection (during production, 30% of pieces checked mid-production, immediate corrections if issues found), Final Random Inspection (AQL 2.5 standard - same as Target, Walmart, Amazon), Measurement Verification (all critical measurements checked against spec sheet, tolerance ±1/4 inch standard), Functionality Testing (zippers, buttons, snaps tested for 50 cycles minimum, seam strength testing, wash testing when required), Compliance Testing (third-party lab testing for CPSC/ASTM when required, lead content, flammability, small parts for kids&#x27; products), Pre-Ship Inspection (100% carton check, proper labeling, packing list accuracy, shipment photos/video provided). Defect rate: We maintain &lt;0.8% defect rate (industry standard is 2-4%). Any defects found are remade at no cost. For first-time orders, many US clients hire third-party inspection companies (SGS, Intertek, Bureau Veritas) - we welcome and facilitate these inspections.

Our US sizing expertise: Standard US Size Ranges: Men&#x27;s (S, M, L, XL, 2XL, 3XL) with proper proportions, Women&#x27;s (XS, S, M, L, XL, 2XL, 3XL) accounting for different body shapes, Plus sizes (1X, 2X, 3X, 4X) with appropriate scaling, Kids&#x27; sizing by age (2T-16) meeting US safety standards. Size Specifications: We use US measurement standards (inches, not cm), Grade rules follow US apparel industry standards, Fit is designed for Western body types (broader shoulders, longer torso, larger dimensions), Length, chest, waist, hip measurements match US consumer expectations. Sizing Consultation: We provide size charts in US sizing format, Sample multiple sizes for fit approval, Adjust patterns based on your target demographic (athletic fit, regular fit, relaxed fit, oversized), Can create custom size runs (more mediums/larges, fewer smalls). Common mistake new US brands make: Using Asian sizing specs results in products 1-2 sizes too small for US customers. We prevent this by defaulting to US standards and having US sizing reference samples in our facility.

Product Compliance Issues: If products fail inspection (CPSC, textile rules, etc.): We investigate root cause immediately, provide remediation plan (relabeling, testing, or remake), share responsibility based on cause (our error = we cover costs, spec change = negotiated), prevent recurrence with updated QC protocols. Complete Rejection (Extremely Rare): If shipment must return to Bangladesh: We warehouse at no cost while resolving issues, remake products if required at discounted rate, credit deposit toward replacement order, absorb return shipping costs if our manufacturing error. Prevention is Key: We provide pre-shipment inspection photos/video, share all compliance certificates upfront, use experienced customs brokers who pre-clear documentation, maintain 24/7 communication during shipping/clearance.
